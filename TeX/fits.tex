\section{Imaginary Wilson coefficients and $R_K$ observables}
\begin{figure}[H]

\label{im:RK_im}
\end{figure}

 Figure \ref{im:RK_im} shows the values of the ratios $R_K$ and $R_{K^*}$ in their respective $q^2$ ranges, when both Wilson coefficients $C_9$ and $C_{10}$ are imaginary, and also we assume $C_9 = -C_{10}$. In all cases the minimum value for the ratio is attained at the SM point $C_9 = -C_{10} =0$. The addition of non-zero imaginary Wilson coefficients results in larger values of $R_K$ and $R_{K^*}$, at odds with the experimental values $R_{K^{(*)}}^{\mathrm{exp}} < R_{K^{(*)}}^{\mathrm{SM}}$.

\caption{Allowed regions for imaginary Wilson coefficients.}
\label{im:fitim}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{im:fitim} we plot the allowed regions for imaginary values of $C_9$ and $C_{10}$ when fitting to measurements of a series of $b\to s \mu^+\mu^-$ observables. In the fit we have included the ratios $R_K$ and $R_{K^*}$, the angular observables $P_4'$ and $P_5'$ and the branching ratios $\mathrm{BR}(B_s\to \mu^+ \mu^-)$ and $\mathrm{BR}(B^0 \to \mu^+ \mu^-)$. The fit was carried by the software \texttt{flavio}, wich computes the $\chi^2$ function with each $(C_9, C_{10})$ pair. The global minimum of the $\chi^2$ was found at $C_9 = 0.31\,i,\ C_{10} = 0.29\;i$. The pull of the SM, defined as the probability that the SM scenario can describe the best fit assuming that $\Delta \chi^2 = \chi^2_{\mathrm{SM}} - \chi^2_{\mathrm{min}}$ follows a $\chi^2$ distribution with 5 degrees of freedom, is of just $2.1\times 10^{-5} \sigma$. That is, the SM result and the best fit are indistinguishable from an statistical point of view. The shaded regions in the plot are $1\sigma$ (darker pink) and $2\sigma$ (lighter pink) away from the best fit.
\section{Z' fit}
\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Bounds on $Z'$ parameter space imposed by $b\to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ decays and $B_s$ mixing.}\label{im:WCZ}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{im:WCZ} shows the bounds on the $Z'$ mass $M_{Z'}$ and the imaginary coupling coupling $\lambda_{23}^Q$ (setting $\lambda_{22}^L=1$) imposed by $b\to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ decays and $B_s$ mixing. Blue lines correspond to the fit to $B_s$-mixing observables $\Delta M_s$ and $A_{\mathrm{CP}}^{\mathrm{mix}}$ (solid line: $\Delta \chi^2 = 1$, dashed lines $\Delta \chi^2 = 4$), red lines to $b\to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ as in Figure \ref{im:fitim} (solid line: $\Delta \chi^2 = 1$, dashed lines $\Delta \chi^2 = 4$), and green regions to the combined fit (dark green: $\Delta \chi^2 = 1$, medium green $\Delta \chi^2 = 4$, light green: $\Delta \chi^2 = 9$). For the $B_s$-mixing fit, the SM offers the best fit, while the best fits for the $b\to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ and global fits is ($M_{Z'} = 11.0\ \mathrm{TeV},\ \lambda_{23}^Q = 0.001\.i$), although the improvement with respect to the SM is negligible. In the low mass region ($M_{Z'} \lesssim 7\ \mathrm{TeV}$) the global fit is dominated by $b\to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ observables, and $B_s$-mixing becomes more important at larger masses. The allowed regions correspond to 'small' Wilson coefficients ($\mathrm{Im} C_{10} < 0.7$, $C_{bs}^{LL} > -3\times 10^{-4}$), except for a narrow region in the $B_s$ fit with $C_{bs}^{LL} \sim -2.7 \times 10^{-3}$.
\section{Leptoquark fit}
\begin{figure}[H]

\resizebox{0.6\textwidth}{!}{\input{Figures/WCLQ.pgf}}
\caption{Bounds on $S_3$ leptoquark parameter space imposed by $b\to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ decays and $B_s$ mixing.}\label{im:WCLQ}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{im:WCLQ} shows the bounds on the $S_3$ leptoquark mass $M_{S_3}$ and the imaginary coupling coupling $y^{QL}_{23} y^{QL*}_{23}$  imposed by $b\to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ decays and $B_s$ mixing. The observables used in the respective fits are the same as in Figure \ref{im:WCZ}. The SM scenario was prefered in all the fits. In contrast to $Z'$ models, $b\to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ observables remain the main contributors to the bounds at masses as large as $M_{S_3} \sim 50\ \mathrm{TeV}$.
