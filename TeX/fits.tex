\section{Imaginary Wilson coefficients and $R_K$ observables}

\end{figure}

 Figure \ref{im:RK_im} shows the values of the ratios $R_K$ and $R_{K^*}$ in their respective $q^2$ ranges, when both Wilson coefficients $C_9$ and $C_{10}$ are imaginary, and also we assume $C_9 = -C_{10}$. In all cases the minimum value for the ratio is attained at the SM point $C_9 = -C_{10} =0$. The addition of non-zero imaginary Wilson coefficients results in larger values of $R_K$ and $R_{K^*}$, at odds with the experimental values $R_{K^{(*)}}^{\mathrm{exp}} < R_{K^{(*)}}^{\mathrm{SM}}$. In contrast, when the Wilson coefficients are real as in Figure \ref{im:RK_re}, values of $R_{K^{(*)}} \sim 0.7$, as in the experimental measurements, are possible.

In Figure \ref{im:fitim} we plot the allowed regions for imaginary values of $C_9$ and $C_{10}$ when fitting to measurements of a series of $b\to s \mu^+\mu^-$ observables. In the fit we have included the ratios $R_K$ and $R_{K^*}$, the angular observables $P_4'$ and $P_5'$. The fit was carried by the software \texttt{flavio}, wich computes the $\chi^2$ function with each $(C_9, C_{10})$ pair. The global minimum of the $\chi^2$ was found at $C_9 = 0.41\,i,\ C_{10} = 0.42\;i$. The pull of the SM, defined as the probability that the SM scenario can describe the best fit assuming that $\Delta \chi^2 = \chi^2_{\mathrm{SM}} - \chi^2_{\mathrm{min}}$ follows a $\chi^2$ distribution with 3 degrees of freedom, is of just $6\times 10^{-4} \sigma$. That is, the SM result and the best fit are indistinguishable from an statistical point of view. The shaded regions in the plot are $1\sigma$ (darker pink) and $2\sigma$ (lighter pink) away from the best fit. Compare this to the fit to real values of the Wilson coefficients, in Figure \ref{im:fitre}. Now the confidence regions are much tighter and do not include the SM point. In fact, the best fit ($C_9 = -1.37$, $C_{10} = 0.21$) improves the SM by $3.49 \sigma$.
\section{Z' fit}

\caption{Bounds on $Z'$ parameter space imposed by $b\to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ decays and $B_s$ mixing.}\label{im:WCZ}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{im:WCZ} shows the bounds on the $Z'$ mass $M_{Z'}$ and the imaginary coupling coupling $\lambda_{23}^Q$ (setting $\lambda_{22}^L=1$) imposed by $b\to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ decays and $B_s$ mixing. Blue lines correspond to the fit to $B_s$-mixing observables $\Delta M_s$ and $A_{\mathrm{CP}}^{\mathrm{mix}}$ (solid lines: $\Delta \chi^2 = 1$, dashed lines: $\Delta \chi^2 = 4$), red lines to $b\to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ as in Figure \ref{im:fitim} plus the branching ratios $\mathrm{BR}(B_s\to \mu^+ \mu^-)$ and $\mathrm{BR}(B^0 \to \mu^+ \mu^-)$ (solid lines: $\Delta \chi^2 = 1$, dashed lines: $\Delta \chi^2 = 4$), and green regions to the combined fit (dark green: $\Delta \chi^2 = 1$, medium green $\Delta \chi^2 = 4$, light green: $\Delta \chi^2 = 9$). The best fit for the $b\to s\mu\mu$ observables is the SM. 

For the $B_s$-mixing observables, the best fit is found at $M_{Z'}= 10.6\,\mathrm{TeV}$, $\lambda_{23}^Q = 0.051\,i$, which corresponds to $C_{bs}^{LL}= -1.63\times 10^{-4}$. The SM has a pull of $\Delta \chi^2 = 1.78$. In addition to the best fit, there is a narrow fringe of allowed parameters when $C_{bs}^{LL} \sim - 2.5\times 10^{-3}$. In fact, both values of the Wilson coefficient can explain the measurement of $\Delta M_s^{\mathrm{exp}}$ using Equation 15 of 1712.06572.

The best fit when all observables are considered is found at $M_{Z'} = 12\, \mathrm{TeV}$, $\lambda_{23}^Q = 0.054\,i$ (although the real best fit needs an even higher $M_{Z'}$), and the pull of the SM is $\Delta \chi^2 = 1.37$.  
\section{Leptoquark fit}
\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Bounds on $S_3$ leptoquark parameter space imposed by $b\to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ decays and $B_s$ mixing.}\label{im:WCLQ}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{im:WCLQ} shows the bounds on the $S_3$ leptoquark mass $M_{S_3}$ and the imaginary coupling coupling $y^{QL}_{32} y^{QL*}_{22}$  imposed by $b\to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ decays and $B_s$ mixing. The observables used in the respective fits are the same as in Figure \ref{im:WCZ}. The SM scenario was prefered again by the $b\to s\mu\mu$ fit.

The fit to $B_s$-mixing observables is similar to the one in $Z'$ models. The best fit is located $M_{S_3}= 19.6\,\mathrm{TeV}$, $y_{32}^{QL} y_{22}^{QL*} = 1.06\,i$, with a SM pull of $\Delta\chi^2 = 1.78$. 

The global fit leaves much more room for the SM scenario that the $Z'$ model. The best fit is located at $M_{S_3} = 50\,\mathrm{TeV}$, $y_{32}^{QL} y_{22}^{QL*} = 0.72\,i$, with a SM pull of only $\Delta\chi^2 = 2\times10^{-3}$.
